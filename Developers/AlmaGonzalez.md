I’m Alma Xochitl Gonzalez Morales, a junior researcher at the University of Guanajuato!

I’m now based in León city in the state of Guanajuato.  It is very close to Guanajuato city, one of the most beautiful in México.  Interestingly, León, and Guanuajuato, host many international events annually, including a Ballon festival, the Rally, and the Cervantino, just to mention some!

In DESI I co-chair the scientists interested in cosmology with the Lyman-alpha forest, i.e I help coordinate everyone to work together!  I also help a little in testing and improving the DESI code. For example, I’ve done some tests to the code that will be used to determine quasar redshifts, using it together with simulated quasars (where we know the truth) so that we can know how well it does! And more recently I've been doing simulations of how will the first year of observations of Lya spectra will look like. I also work with graduate students, mostly from the University of Guanajuato, to develop their own projects within DESI.

For me, the most intriguing aspect of astronomy/cosmology is the nature of Dark Energy and Dark Matter. Contributing to know more about these two mysterious 
components of our Universe is just astounding!  Even though DESI is mostly focused on Dark Energy (as the name suggests!), the gathered information will also 
be very helpful to understand Dark Matter.  Now that I’m closely following the status of the project I realize how much work is involved and that it is truly 
a huge effort from many people.  I’m so excited about all the science and knowledge that is being developed every day.

I’m really interested in the popularization of science, particularly for girls. I hope some of them in the future will become scientists! I dedicate some of my free time to a community, [Iconmunity](https://www.instagram.com/iconmunity/), that organizes small workshops, talks, and science shows. Our top program is [Technovation Girls Guanajuato](https://twitter.com/TechnovationGTO), that is about mentoring teams to produce apps that adds to solve a problem in society, enviroments, you name it... These programs are close to my heart.
