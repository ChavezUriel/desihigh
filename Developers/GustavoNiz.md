# Dr Gustavo Niz

Hola, I am [Gustavo Niz](http://fisica.ugto.mx/~gfm/group-members/niz/), a DESI scientist who started with [String Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) in the early 2000s and have gradually moved to more observational cosmology.
Following a PhD from the University of Cambridge, two posdocs in the UK, a sabbatical year on a sailboat(!) and a few adventures around the globe, I moved
to the city of Leon, in 2012, where I am an associate professor at the University of Guanajuato.

Currently, most of my research focuses on using 'three-point statistics', a fancy way to say that I look for triangles in the distribution of matter in the
Universe.  By studying how probable it is to find three galaxies on the vertices of a given triangular shape, one can learn about fundamental physics, including the nature of dark energy, dark matter, the first few seconds in the life of the Universe, the weight of neutrino and test Einsteinâ€™s theory of gravity.
I hope these ideas become some of the most important in DESI and the next generation of galaxy surveys!

Apart from advising our talented group of researchers and highly motivated graduate students in DESI, I am the Director of the Instituto Avanzado de Cosmologia 
[IAC](http://www.iac.edu.mx).  It is a Mexican association that strengthens the research community in cosmology and promotes the study of the Universe among the 
general public in Mexico.  Among other events, the IAC organises the world-class event 'Essential Cosmology for the Next Generation', unofficially known as 
['Cosmology on the Beach'](http://www.cosmologyonthebeach.com/).
